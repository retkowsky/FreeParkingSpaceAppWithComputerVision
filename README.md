# Free Parking Space App With ComputerVision
Free parking space app with ComputerVision

This is an example of an Azure Custom Vision object detection model to detect cars from a camera.
Then we can have the numbers of parked cars per area and we can identify the number of free spaces in the parking lot.
We can get as well the number of cars who are entering or leaving the parking lot.
